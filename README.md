Swipe right left to seek, up down to change volume. You can also click-n-drag. While using a mouse, clicking and dragging the middle mouse button changes playback speed, right left for the changing relative speed and up down for setting it back to 1.00.

You need to set `no-window-dragging` in you `mpv.conf` for this script to work.
